# basicStatsCLI

CLI tool to count mean, max, min, range of a given list of integers.
Given a list of N integers, find its mean (as a double), maximum value, minimum value, and range. 
Your program will first ask for N, the number of integers in the list, which the user will input. 
Then the user will input N more numbers.
 Example:
 Three numbers are given: 2, 1, 3. The output should    be as follows:
 Mean: 2
 Max: 3
 Min: 1
 Range: 2
